Introduction to Programming
Assignment : 03

 

Write code for the following (while loop) questions.
1) Print Numbers from 1 to 10:
Write a program using a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

2) Sum of First N Natural Numbers:
Ask the user for a number 'N', and then sum up all natural numbers up to N using a while loop.

3) Countdown Timer:
Write a program that counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints "Liftoff!".

4) Guess the Number:
Implement a number guessing game. The program should pick a fixed number, and the user has to guess it. The loop should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

5) Calculate the Average:
Write a program that continuously asks users to enter a number until they enter "0". At the end, print the average of all entered numbers.

6) Password Retry System:
Create a program that asks for a password with a maximum of three attempts. If the correct password, "Python123", is entered, print "Access granted", otherwise print "Access denied" after three incorrect attempts.

7) Print All Even Numbers up to N:
Ask the user to input a number 'N', then use a while loop to print all even numbers from 1 to N.

8) Multiplication Table:
Ask for a number from the user and print its multiplication table up to 10 using a while loop.

9) Find the Largest Number:
Prompt the user to enter numbers one by one, and continue accepting numbers until the user enters "0". Print the largest number entered.

10) Factorial of a Number:
Ask the user for a non-negative integer and calculate the factorial of that number using a while loop.

Write code for the following (for loop) questions.
1) Print Numbers from 1 to 10:
Ask the students to write a Python program using a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

2) Calculate the Sum of First 10 Natural Numbers:
Write a program to sum up the first 10 natural numbers using a for loop.

3) Print the Multiplication Table for a Given Number:
Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints the multiplication table for that number up to 10 using a for loop.

4) Print All Even Numbers Between 1 and 20:
Use a for loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.

5) Count the Number of Digits in an Integer:
Write a Python program to count the number of digits in a given integer. Use a for loop with str() conversion.

6) Reverse a String:
Write a program to reverse a given string using a for loop.

7) Calculate Factorial of a Number:
Ask the user for a non-negative integer and calculate the factorial of that number using a for loop.

8) Find the Sum of All Numbers in a List:
Write a program that sums all the numbers in a given list using a for loop.

9) Check if a Number is Prime:
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and then uses a for loop to check if it is a prime number.

10) Print Each Character of a String on a New Line:
Write a program that prints each character of a given string on a new line using a for loop.

Write code for the following advance questions using loops.
1) Print a Pyramid Pattern:
Write a program to print a pyramid pattern with stars (*). The user specifies the number of rows.

    *

   ***

  *****

 *******

*********

2) Find All Prime Numbers Up to N:
Implement a program that finds all prime numbers up to N.

3) Create a Zigzag Sequence:
Write a program to create a zigzag sequence with numbers. The sequence should alternate between increasing and decreasing numbers sequentially and use nested loops as shown below:
1

2 1

1 2 3

4 3 2 1

1 2 3 4 5

4) Fibonacci Sequence with a Twist:
Write a program to generate a Fibonacci sequence up to n elements where every number divisible by 3 is replaced with "Fizz", every number divisible by 5 is replaced with "Buzz", and numbers divisible by both are replaced with "FizzBuzz".
